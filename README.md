# SmallBox Wireframe

Wireframe build for SmallBox

***

## Notes:

#### - Navigation

I eliminated the appearance of the hamburger menu when the navigation is not condensed to mobile/tablet-friendly dimensions. It seemed redundant and non-standard to have it appear at all times.

Usually, I would check with the designer to see if there is a specific reason the design was laid out like this and should keep it as is.

#### - Carousel

I attempted to make the carousel work without a JavaScript library, but unfortunately, I could not make it work well.

#### - Why Choose Us

Upon viewing this section in the Figma document, I noticed that it does not follow the pattern established within the rest of the design and does not follow the grid.

Again, I would check with the designer to ensure this was a simple mistake and not a specific decision before committing to laying it out.
